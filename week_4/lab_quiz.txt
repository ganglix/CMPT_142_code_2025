Write a program that asks the user to enter a POSITIVE number. The program
should keep using CONSOLE INPUT to get the user's answer AS MANY TIMES AS
NEEDED until they enter a positive number.


Define a FUNCITON that accepts a list of integers. The function should
RETURN True if the list CONTAINS at least one NEGATIVE NUMBER, and False
otherwise.

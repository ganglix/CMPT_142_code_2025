# Exercise 2

# Suppose we have dictionary availability:
# keys: friend’s name
# values: list of days they are available to play a game
# (a) Write a function that accepts an availability dictionary and returns a new dictionary mapping days to
# friends who can play that day.
# (b) Using the function from a):
# Find the day most friends can attend to play the game
# List who can and can not attend the session that day

availability = {"Neo":      ["Monday"],
                "Morpheus": ["Sunday"],
                "Smith":    ["Monday", "Tuesday"]}

def scheduler(availability):
    """
    Convert a dictionary of availability to a dictionary of schedule
    :param availability: dict, name: list of available days
    :return: dict, day: list of available names
    """



# find the day that most friends can attend



# List who can and can not attend the session that day

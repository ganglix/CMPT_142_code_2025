# Generalization of functions (or algorithms)
# is the process of modifying a function/algorithm that
# solves a specific problem so that it can solve a wider range of problems, or a larger number of
# instances of the same problem

# How can we generalize each function for reusability?
# (a) This function computes the most number of cards in a 52 card deck that can be dealt equally amongst
# four people

def cards_per_player():
    return 52 // 4


# (b) This function computes the number of hours required to watch a 26 episode television show consisting
# of 22 minute episodes

def total_watch_time():
    return 26 * 22 / 60

# This demonstration shows you how to call methods on string objects.


# initialize some variables to play with
url = ''

# find the location of the first period in the url


# count the number of periods in the url




#----------------------------------------
# s = ' CMPT 142 '
# remove white space




# ------------------------
# count the number of characters in the url after removing "www."




# useful in practice?




# strings are immutable, all these methods create a copy




# how do I know what kind of methods are out there? How do I know the syntax/usage?

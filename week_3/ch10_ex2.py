# Daily variance of flu tests can be high. We often calculate the
# 7-day average instead: for each day, take the AVERAGE of
# the preceding 7 days (including itself)
# Using the flu_data list, create a new list where the values
# are the 7-day average for each day. Start from day 7
# Then, plot the data in the new list
# Hint: Slicing might be useful

# A given list called pkg_weights contains weights of parcels
# (in lbs) queued for shipping. Write Python code that:
# (a) Creates list light_pkgs of parcels that weigh less than 5
# lbs from pkg_weights
# (b) Removes parcels from pkg_weights that exceed 15 lbs
# (c) Print the:
# • contents of light_pkgs in ascending order
# • number of parcels in light_pkgs
# • number of parcels removed from pkg_weights

pkg_weights = [2, 6, 8, 34, 56, 67, 4, 2, 33]

# (a) Creates list light_pkgs of parcels that weigh less than 5



# (b) Removes parcels from pkg_weights that exceed 15 lbs



# (c) Print the:
# • contents of light_pkgs in ascending order



# • number of parcels in light_pkgs



# • number of parcels removed from pkg_weights














# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~things I want to mention
# Modifying list while iterating DO NOT DO IT
# don't change list if possible
# use a clone

Example
Define a FUNCTION that accepts a list of strings. The function should RETURN a
count indicating HOW MANY of those strings START with the letter "j".

def count_j_start(L):
    count = 0
    for s in L:
        if s[0] == 'j':      # if 'j' in s:    # containing 'j'
            count += 1
    return count
